# DataStics
This is a walkthrough for our final year project where we have built a website for Recommending crops to the farmers using Machine Learning 

Deployment is done using deploy branch

You can access it at [Website](https://datastics.herokuapp.com/)

Note: The website may take a minute to load sometimes, as the server may be in hibernate state
